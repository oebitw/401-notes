### What is OAuth
OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords

### How OAuth works?
OAuth allows third-party services to exchange your information without you having to give away your password. Because the more you give away your password, the more you give away your passwords, the more likely it is that your passwords will get compromised.

OAuth uses a system of tokens. Called “access tokens”. An access token gives one third-party source temporary access to a limited amount of your personal information on another third-party source.
