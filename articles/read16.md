# AWS: Cloud Servers

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1.Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

    1. The user opens the browser, and search for URL.
    2. The browser makes a request for that URL.
    3. The request hits the Rails router. The router maps the URL to the correct controller and action to handle the request.
    4. The action receives the request and pass it on to the view.
    5. The view renders the page as HTML.
    6. The controller sends the HTML back to the browser. The page loads and the user sees it.
    
2. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC

It is the operator and the messenger of the requests.


3. What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
    
    To Publish the webapp online and move it from local host to cloud.


## Vocabulary Terms

# Preparation Material

## Virtual Machine

a virtual machine is the virtualization/emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination.

## Virtualization

is software that manipulates hardware, while cloud computing refers to a service that results from that manipulation. You can't have cloud computing without virtualization.

## AWS

Cloud computing gives you access to servers, storage, databases, and a broad set of application services over the Internet. A cloud services provider such as Amazon Web Services, owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.

 ## AWS Elastic Beanstalk
 
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed
